## Step 1
Import nltk library and download books from Gutenberg corpus

## Step 2
Get a list with all book-titles of Gutenberg and keep only the 10 first

## Step 3
Iterate through books and read their raw text content

## Step 4
Use word_tokenizer to split each book content to words/tokens and keep the unique set for each book into one list - *vocabulary_per_book*

## Step 5
Because the books may have the same words in their vocabulary, we keep only the unique one of the previous step's list of words - *vocabulary_final*.
