# Knapsack Data taken from : [DataSet](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/knapsack_01/knapsack_01.html)

# Each knapsack problem is compound from 4 .tx files,

[1.] *_c.txt contains the capacity of knapsack,  maybe there are multiple capacities

[2.] *_w.txt contains the weight values of objects

[3.] *_p.txt contains the profits of each object

[4.] *_s.txt the optimal selection for checking solution -- O.H.E of choices


## Problem 1 :
10 weights and capacity of 165

## Problem 2:
15 Weights and capacity of 750 optimal profit 1458

## Problem 3:
5 Weights and capacity of 26
